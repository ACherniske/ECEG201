# Note that the ESP32-S3 has analog in channels (ADC, or analog to digital converter)
# but it does NOT have a DAC (digital to analog converter).  Hence, our Feather
# cannot output true analog signals.  Forunately, we do not need to output an analog
# signal here, just a binary "high" or "low" so we'll repurpose one of the analog "Ax"
# pins on the DAMNED PCB to act as a digital pin.

# Convert the digital value to a voltage...
# Since the analog to digital converter on the ESP32-S3 has 12 bits of resoltuion,
# a voltage of 0V gives 0 and the maximum voltage of 3.3 V should give 2^12 = 4096.
# However CircuitPython scales all inputs to 16 bits, 2^16 = 65536.

    Converts the voltage reading from a TMP36 temperature sensor to Celsius.

    The TMP36 provides a voltage output that is linearly proportional to the
    temperature in Celsius.  The formula to convert voltage to Celsius is:

        Celsius = (Voltage - 0.5V) / 0.01V/Â°C

    Args:
        voltage (float): The voltage reading from the TMP36 sensor in volts.

    Returns:
        float: The temperature in degrees Celsius.

    Converts the voltage reading from a TMP36 temperature sensor to Fahrenheit.

    This function first converts the voltage to Celsius and then converts
    the Celsius temperature to Fahrenheit using the standard formula:

        Fahrenheit = (Celsius * 9/5) + 32
